# 🎓 IITM BS Data Science CGPA Calculator

### *Because calculating your GPA with a calculator app is for amateurs* 📊

## 🤯 What is this?

A **ridiculously over-engineered CGPA calculator** for IITM BS Data Science students. Built at 2 AM by **Prajwal** because manually calculating CGPA is so last semester. 🚀

## ✨ Why This Exists

I was tired of:
- Opening calculator app like a caveman 🦕
- Adding subjects twice by mistake
- Doing mental math at 3 AM (spoiler: it never ended well)

So I built this beauty with fancy animations and IITM branding because we deserve nice things! 

## 🎪 Features

- All 26 IITM BS subjects included
- No duplicate subjects (you're welcome)
- Pretty animations that make bad grades hurt less
- Mobile responsive (calculate your doom on the bus!)
- Official IITM grading scale (S to U, the alphabet of anxiety)

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open `index.html`
2. Add subjects and grades
3. Hit calculate
4. Either celebrate 🎉 or question life choices 😭

## 🐛 Bugs

- Might show 10.0 CGPA (double-check, it's probably wrong)
- Doesn't fix your actual grades (still working on that feature)
- Time travel not supported yet
